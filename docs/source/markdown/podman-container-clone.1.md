## NAME
podman\-container\-clone - Creates a copy of an existing container

## SYNOPSIS
**podman container clone** [*options*] *container* *name* *image*

## DESCRIPTION
**podman container clone** creates a copy of a container, recreating the original with an identical configuration. This command takes three arguments: the first being the container id or name to clone, the second argument in this command can change the name of the clone from the default of $ORIGINAL_NAME-clone, and the third is a new image to use in the cloned container.

## OPTIONS

#### **--cpu-period**=*limit*

Set the CPU period for the Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS), which is a
duration in microseconds. Once the container's CPU quota is used up, it will
not be scheduled to run until the current period ends. Defaults to 100000
microseconds.

On some systems, changing the CPU limits may not be allowed for non-root
users. For more details, see
https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/master/troubleshooting.md#26-running-containers-with-cpu-limits-fails-with-a-permissions-error

If none is specified, the original container's cpu period is used

#### **--cpu-quota**=*limit*

Limit the CPU Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) quota.

Limit the container's CPU usage. By default, containers run with the full
CPU resource. The limit is a number in microseconds. If a number is provided,
the container will be allowed to use that much CPU time until the CPU period
ends (controllable via **--cpu-period**).

On some systems, changing the CPU limits may not be allowed for non-root
users. For more details, see
https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/master/troubleshooting.md#26-running-containers-with-cpu-limits-fails-with-a-permissions-error

If none is specified, the original container's CPU quota are used.

#### **--cpu-rt-period**=*microseconds*

Limit the CPU real-time period in microseconds

Limit the container's Real Time CPU usage. This option tells the kernel to restrict the container's Real Time CPU usage to the period specified.

This option is not supported on cgroups V2 systems.

If none is specified, the original container's CPU runtime period is used.


#### **--cpu-rt-runtime**=*microseconds*

Limit the CPU real-time runtime in microseconds.

Limit the containers Real Time CPU usage. This option tells the kernel to limit the amount of time in a given CPU period Real Time tasks may consume. Ex:
Period of 1,000,000us and Runtime of 950,000us means that this container could consume 95% of available CPU and leave the remaining 5% to normal priority tasks.

The sum of all runtimes across containers cannot exceed the amount allotted to the parent cgroup.

This option is not supported on cgroups V2 systems.

#### **--cpu-shares**=*shares*

CPU shares (relative weight)

By default, all containers get the same proportion of CPU cycles. This proportion
can be modified by changing the container's CPU share weighting relative
to the weighting of all other running containers.

To modify the proportion from the default of 1024, use the **--cpu-shares**
option to set the weighting to 2 or higher.

The proportion will only apply when CPU-intensive processes are running.
When tasks in one container are idle, other containers can use the
left-over CPU time. The actual amount of CPU time will vary depending on
the number of containers running on the system.

For example, consider three containers, one has a cpu-share of 1024 and
two others have a cpu-share setting of 512. When processes in all three
containers attempt to use 100% of CPU, the first container would receive
50% of the total CPU time. If a fourth container is added with a cpu-share
of 1024, the first container only gets 33% of the CPU. The remaining containers
receive 16.5%, 16.5% and 33% of the CPU.

On a multi-core system, the shares of CPU time are distributed over all CPU
cores. Even if a container is limited to less than 100% of CPU time, it can
use 100% of each individual CPU core.

For example, consider a system with more than three cores.
container **{C0}** is started with **-c=512** running one process, and another container
**{C1}** with **-c=1024** running two processes, this can result in the following
division of CPU shares:

PID    container	CPU	CPU share
100    {C0}		0	100% of CPU0
101    {C1}		1	100% of CPU1
102    {C1}		2	100% of CPU2

If none are specified, the original container's CPU shares are used.

#### **--cpus**

Set a number of CPUs for the container that overrides the original containers CPU limits. If none are specified, the original container's Nano CPUs are used.

This is shorthand
for **--cpu-period** and **--cpu-quota**, so only **--cpus** or either both the **--cpu-period** and **--cpu-quota** options can be set.

#### **--cpuset-cpus**

CPUs in which to allow execution (0-3, 0,1). If none are specified, the original container's CPUset is used.

#### **--cpuset-mems**=*nodes*

Memory nodes (MEMs) in which to allow execution (0-3, 0,1). Only effective on NUMA systems.

If there are four memory nodes on the system (0-3), use `--cpuset-mems=0,1`
then processes in the container will only use memory from the first
two memory nodes.

If none are specified, the original container's CPU memory nodes are used.

#### **--destroy**

Remove the original container that we are cloning once used to mimic the configuration.

#### **--force**, **-f**

Force removal of the original container that we are cloning. Can only be used in conjunction with **--destroy**.

#### **--memory**, **-m**=*limit*

Memory limit (format: `<number>[<unit>]`, where unit = b (bytes), k (kilobytes), m (megabytes), or g (gigabytes))

Allows the memory available to a container to be constrained. If the host
supports swap memory, then the **-m** memory setting can be larger than physical
RAM. If a limit of 0 is specified (not using **-m**), the container's memory is
not limited. The actual limit may be rounded up to a multiple of the operating
system's page size (the value would be very large, that's millions of trillions).

If no memory limits are specified, the original container's will be used.

#### **--memory-reservation**=*limit*

Memory soft limit (format: `<number>[<unit>]`, where unit = b (bytes), k (kilobytes), m (megabytes), or g (gigabytes))

After setting memory reservation, when the system detects memory contention
or low memory, containers are forced to restrict their consumption to their
reservation. So you should always set the value below **--memory**, otherwise the
hard limit will take precedence. By default, memory reservation will be the same
as memory limit from the container being cloned.

#### **--memory-swap**=*limit*

A limit value equal to memory plus swap. Must be used with the  **-m**
(**--memory**) flag. The swap `LIMIT` should always be larger than **-m**
(**--memory**) value. By default, the swap `LIMIT` will be set to double
the value of --memory if specified. Otherwise, the container being cloned will be used to derive the swap value.

The format of `LIMIT` is `<number>[<unit>]`. Unit can be `b` (bytes),
`k` (kilobytes), `m` (megabytes), or `g` (gigabytes). If you don't specify a
unit, `b` is used. Set LIMIT to `-1` to enable unlimited swap.

#### **--memory-swappiness**=*number*

Tune a container's memory swappiness behavior. Accepts an integer between 0 and 100.

This flag is not supported on cgroups V2 systems.

#### **--name**

Set a custom name for the cloned container. The default if not specified is of the syntax: **<ORIGINAL_NAME>-clone**

#### **--pod**=*name*

Clone the container in an existing pod.  It is helpful to move a container to an
existing pod.  The container will join the pod shared namespaces, losing its configuration
that conflicts with the shared namespaces.

#### **--run**

When set to true, this flag runs the newly created container after the
clone process has completed, this specifies a detached running mode.
