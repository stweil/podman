# This containers.conf file is used to test enforcing short-name resolution to
# docker.io for Podman's *compat* API.  By default, the compat API defaults to
# resolving to docker.io only.  The behavior can be altered by configuring the
# containers.conf as done below in which case short names are subject to aliases,
# "localhost/" and the unqualified-search registries.
